Additional Information:
This image contains one or more objects whose brightness exceeds the detector's saturation level. This sometimes produces a "tail" of bright and/or dark pixels to the right of the object. You may also notice a faint vertical white stripe passing through the saturated object; this is an artifact called "frame transfer smear" and is associated with the incomplete removal of signal produced when the image is transferred from the optically active region of the detector to the storage region of the detector. If the target is badly saturated, you may also notice a faint, X-shaped feature nearly centered on the object; these are optical diffraction spikes.

Additional Information: This composite of enhanced color images of Pluto (lower right) and Charon (upper left), was taken by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft as it passed through the Pluto system on July 14, 2015. This image highlights the striking differences between Pluto and Charon. The color and brightness of both Pluto and Charon have been processed identically to allow direct comparison of their surface properties, and to highlight the similarity between Charon’s polar red terrain and Pluto’s equatorial red terrain. Pluto and Charon are shown with approximately correct relative sizes, but their true separation is not to scale.

Description: Pluto and Charon are shown in a composite of natural-color images from New Horizons.
Time: five hours before closest approach to Pluto July 13 and 14, 2015
Exposure: Images from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with color data from the Ralph instrument to produce these views. The image was made with the blue, red, and near-infrared color filters of Ralph’s Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, and shows colors that are similar, but not identical, to what would be seen with the human eye.
Target: Pluto and Charon
Range: 150,000 miles (250,000 kilometers)

Photo Credit: NASA/JUAPL/SwRI, Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) & Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC)

Additional Information: Pluto and Charon are shown in a composite of natural-color images from New Horizons. Images from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with color data from the Ralph instrument to produce these views, which portray Pluto and Charon as an observer riding on the spacecraft would see them. The images were acquired on July 13 and 14, 2015.

Pluto and Charon are shown in enhanced color in this image, which is the highest-resolution color image of the pair yet returned to Earth by New Horizons.  It was taken with the spacecraft’s Ralph instrument about five hours before closest approach to Pluto, from a range of 150,000 miles (250,000 kilometers). The image highlights the contrasting appearance of the two worlds: Charon is mostly gray, -- with a dark reddish polar cap -- while Pluto shows a wide variety of subtle color variations, including yellowish patches on the north polar cap and subtly contrasting colors for the two halves of Pluto’s “heart”, now informally named Tombaugh Regio (Tombaugh Region), seen in the upper right quadrant of the image.

In order to fit Pluto and Charon in the same frame in their correct relative positions, the image has been rotated so the north poles of both Pluto and Charon are pointing toward the upper left.  The image was made with the blue, red, and near-infrared color filters of Ralph’s Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, and shows colors that are similar, but not identical, to what would be seen with the human eye.

Additional Information: Pluto's haze layer shows its blue color in this picture taken by the New Horizons Ralph/Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC). The high-altitude haze is thought to be similar in nature to that seen at Saturn’s moon Titan. The source of both hazes likely involves sunlight-initiated chemical reactions of nitrogen and methane, leading to relatively small, soot-like particles (called tholins) that grow as they settle toward the surface. This image was generated by software that combines information from blue, red and near-infrared images to replicate the color a human eye would perceive as closely as possible.

Additional Information: NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto’s surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers).  The viewer is encouraged to zoom in on the full resolution image on a larger screen to fully appreciate the complexity of Pluto’s surface features.
